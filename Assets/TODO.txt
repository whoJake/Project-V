Camera
	ThirdPersonController.cs
		Collision for focus point towards camera
		Add collision to camera
		Let collision layers for this be editable
		?Zoom settings
		Add better orbit setup
		Maybe implement some kind of focus point catch up when object is moving fast but camera isnt
	ThirdPersonControllerEditor.cs
		Have rect/seperator around willControlTransform bool so that it looks nicer
Player
	PlayerMovement.cs
		Update PlayerMovementEditor.cs
		Add some events that are triggered by actions like Jump or HitGround
		Think about moving gravity and jump height to StatHandler
		Implement the jump implementation that was explained in the video
		Move JumpHeight to StatHandler
		JumpTime stays in PlayerMovement
		Maybe look at switching to UnityInput 2.0 as it uses input events that you subscribe to rather than reading them straight from Input class
		Implement momentum to movement whilst in the air
		Convert movement to adding an acceleration instead of setting velocity
		Look for disable of bunnyhopping (might be in switching to UnityInput 2.0)
	StatHandler.cs
		Is queried by mechanics in order to get statistics such as PlayerMovement.cs asking for the speed when its about to move
		Events for StatChanged etc to get ready for implementing it into UI
	Animation
		Seperate movement of Upper and Lower body
		Upper body is controlled by look direction and always aims at it
		Lower body responds to movement and lightly follows the upper body to align itself

		Upper Body
			Holds torso, arms and head
			Faces towards focus point on all axis
		Lower Body
			Holds hips and legs
			Follows closely behind the upper body to align itself overtime instead of instantly
			Will rotate based on player movement
Items
	Design
		Item rarity colours
		?Items are held by different types of plants/objects (ice, big plant) which dictates their rarity aswell as their element
		How they should be displayed on the ground
		Rotate or follow camera

		Item comes up from ground, hung slightly away from the floor with a small plant branch
		Element erupts from underneath it which infuses it with its element
		Elemental eruption under item seems good with a generic holder for the item

		Element types
			Fire/Ice/Water/Ground + others Gravitational etc
			Something more abstract? Starrail types
			How should they interact with eachother? Synergies ofc but should some detriment others? Maybe sacrifice one part of them for something different

	Gameplay
		How are items discovered across runs
		?Check-points to hand in items so they can be upgraded
		?Risk keeping the item for the run or hand it in so that you can upgrade/unlock it for the next run
		How does rarity change with depth/layer
		When are items dropped. From bosses? From monster packs? From chests/item areas?
	Implementation
		Base item class that can hold an item
		Interactable interface? onInteract(Player player)?
		Will the stat buff directly affect stats or will it be added to a pool that recalculates stats after a pickup
