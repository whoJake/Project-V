Camera
	ThirdPersonController.cs
		Have focus point be a GameObject
		Collision for focus point towards camera
		Move outside of Player like Cinemachine
		Add collision to camera
		Let collision layers for this be editable
		?Zoom settings
		This controller needs to be seperated from Player so that the camera can be controller by other scripts more easily
Player
	PlayerMovement.cs
		Update PlayerMovementEditor.cs
		Refactor code in Update() to be more readable
		Change/fix interaction and equations between gravity and jump velocity
		Add some events that are triggered by actions like Jump or HitGround
	StatHandler.cs
		Create
		Holds all stats of the player like movespeed etc
		Is queried by mechanics in order to get statistics such as PlayerMovement.cs asking for the speed when its about to move
		Events for StatChanged etc to get ready for implementing it into UI
	Animation
		Seperate movement of Upper and Lower body
		Upper body is controlled by look direction and always aims at it
		Lower body responds to movement and lightly follows the upper body to align itself

		Upper Body
			Holds torso, arms and head
			Faces towards focus point on all axis
		Lower Body
			Holds hips and legs
			Follows closely behind the upper body to align itself overtime instead of instantly
			Will rotate based on player movement
Items
	Design
		Item rarity colours
		How they should be displayed on the ground
		Rotate or follow camera
	Gameplay
		How are items discovered across runs
		?Check-points to hand in items so they can be upgraded
		?Risk keeping the item for the run or hand it in so that you can upgrade/unlock it for the next run
		How does rarity change with depth/layer
		When are items dropped. From bosses? From monster packs? From chests/item areas?
	Implementation
		Base item class that can hold an item
		Interactable interface? onInteract(Player player)?
		Will the stat buff directly affect stats or will it be added to a pool that recalculates stats after a pickup
