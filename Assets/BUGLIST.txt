Clipping issues with camera when camera is close to a wall
Camera can clip into player due to the buffer length
With disabling bunnyhopping, controller.isGrounded seems to be really slow at detecting whether it is grounded or not. UnityInput 2.0 would definitely fix this issue
Jumping seems a bit buggy when walking into/away from a sloped ceiling. Kind of cool mechanic might be worth keeping
